# Task 03 - Pull Request review: showing correct dates

> [!NOTE]
> This part will make you take the role of a reviewer in a made-up pull-request. We want to see how you review code from others as well getting a feeling of your balance between constructive feedback and code-ownership.

Our team recently received a bug request regarding the dates shown in the matches table. Looks like the times are not being displayed correctly for some Clubs in the US. A junior team-mate already did the analysis, found the root cause of the problem, and prepared a fix. You need to review it before it can be merged into the release pipeline.

**Dos and Don'ts**
- You **must** leave a review stating if you would ✅ **Approve**; 💬 **Comment** ;or ❌ **Request changes**.
- You **should** leave a review in the code's PR itself if you find it necessary.
- You **shouldn't** make changes in code itself.

**Opening the Test Pull Request**

We are now going to open the pull request for this task.

First you need to enable the **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** checkbox for your repo. You can do that by going into Settings › Actions › General › Workflow permissions. Make sure you tick the associated checkbox and click **Save**.

Now we can run the **Open Test Pull Request** workflow by navigating to Actions › Open Test Pull Request › Run workflow.

This will create a branch, commit the changes of your team-mate, push the branch into your repo, and open a the Pull Request you need to review.
